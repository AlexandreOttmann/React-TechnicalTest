# Test for Fintech Startup

Here is my test submitted for a job in a French Bank Startup, Shine.

## Candidate Playground

If you are reading this, you have been invited to participate in a development exercise with the aim of joining our team.

Although tailored, this exercise represents the type of functionality you may be developing with us.

Depending on your skill set (back, front, full stack...), you have been given a specific scenario. Start by reading it carefully to understand what is expected of you.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

You should install or switch to Node v16 before starting

### Get the assessment statement

Run the included storybook and go to the instructions section:

```bash
npx http-server ./storybook
```

### What's inside

This repo contains two projects.

- [`/server`](./server/README.md) is the backend side
- [`/client`](./client/README.md) is the frontend side

Both are independent projects and must be run in parallel.

You should refer to the corresponding documentation for initialization and commands.
